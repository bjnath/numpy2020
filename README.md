# Hosted live notebooks from GitHub pages

- A [live notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bjnath/numpy_ipynb/blob/master/tutorial-svd_gh.ipynb) of Melissa's SVD tutorial; here's a 
 [static version](https://github.com/bjnath/numpy_ipynb/blob/master/tutorial-svd_gh.ipynb). I created the notebook in Colab by copy-and-paste.
 
- Another [live notebook](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/bjnath/numpy_ipynb/master?filepath=tutorial-svd_gh.ipyn), from Binder.

- Existing ipynbs can also be displayed 
[live](https://colab.research.google.com/github/justmarkham/pycon-2018-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb).
Any [notebook on Github](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb) can go live; the example is 
[a Pycon 2018 talk by Kevin Markham](https://github.com/justmarkham/pycon-2018-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb).
