# numpy2020

- Melissa's tutorial on this page
opened directly as a [**live notebook**](https://colab.research.google.com/github/bjnath/numpy_ipynb/blob/master/tutorial-svd_gh.ipynb);
it can be done for [any notebook on Github](https://colab.research.google.com/github/googlecolab/colabtools/blob/master/notebooks/colab-github-demo.ipynb).

- [**tutorial-svd_gh.ipynb**](https://github.com/bjnath/numpy_ipynb/blob/master/tutorial-svd_gh.ipynb) is the static notebook. I created it in in colab via copy and paste.

- **tutorial.ipynb** is an existing ipynb 
[a Pycon 2018 talk by Kevin Markham](https://github.com/justmarkham/pycon-2018-tutorial/blob/master/tutorial.ipynb) 
uploaded to colab (to pick up a colab badge) and downloaded here.
